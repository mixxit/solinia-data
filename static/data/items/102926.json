Through this book, i hope to open your eyes on the issue of religion and magic and their relationship.","When i Spawned into this world, i had no idea what to expect. i gently skimmed the informational signs and globally asked \"what race should i be\" rather than look it up on the website. I got a lot of recomendations some sound really cool like \"halfdragon\"","and some i could care less about, but one gentleman caught my eye. he seemed very wise and told me of the Highhuman race, i quickly looked it up on the website and it looked interesting. so i went with my gut and chose highhuman. Nice gentleman met up ","with me and gave me a tour of the whole capital and alliance town. The gentleman's name was Riddler, i had taken a liking to the man and we became friends. on our travels, he showed me a spell, and from there on out, i was hooked on magic.","      Something that upsets me is that it seems no one knows much about magic all they know is how to use it. But magic is more than casting a lightning spell on your enemy. Magic is something to much harder to understand than most anything. Magic is a ","Gateway. Magic is a gateway to and from places, to and from worlds, its a gateway to knowledge, and its a gateway to the soul. Something that's unknown to most is that something else has the same characteristics. Religion. wheather its god or ala or notch","they all describe the same person, the creater, the salvationist, the higher power. The truth is, without this god, we would not have magic, and without magic we would not have this higher power. Magic and Religion walk down a dangerous sidewalk, hand in ","hand, heart in heart. Some think that with magic they can conquire anyone, do anything. this is not true. Like a big brother, the higher power will damn those who abuse magics power. Those who think they are higher than the higher power will be sent lower","So no, you are not better than god. if this creater created you and the world around you, how could you be better? No matter who, king or peasent, knight or resident, we are all the same in the eyes of Magic and The Creater. May they both be on your side."],"neverDrop":false,"lastUpdatedTime":"Jan 26, 2020 8:39:55 PM","itemType":"None","QuestId":0,"appearanceId":0,"baneDmgBody":0,"baneDmgRace":0,"baneDmgBodyAmount":0,"baneDmgRaceAmount":0}
